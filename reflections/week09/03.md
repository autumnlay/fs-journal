## Questions

1. What is a Base64 Encoded Image?

It is a way to "optimize" an image by encoding it to the Base64 and including it straight into the HTML.

2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?

Looks like there are a lot of issues with this. It makes the dowlnoad size larger, CPU Overhead is worse, more caching issues and a more difficult user experience. 

3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?

We are try to work with data in small portions, Base64 makes that very difficult  because the file is bigger. Back in the day we needed it because everything had to be binary, so it only made sense to have it. Now we don't need everything to be encoded exactly in that binary.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work

I understand a lot more on transitions! They are really fun and I understand more on how to get that many-to-many data. It was a little hard at first, but we figured it out after a while!
