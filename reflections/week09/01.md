## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

Firbase, download feature, sockets, vue animations, vue tour and node.js

2. What went well so far?

Our group dynamic works very well with each other. We are able to solve all of our problems quickly and know where to go if we do end up getting pretty stuck.

3. What would you do differently? Why?

We keep having moments of down time. Most of the time it is because we are waiting for someone on one side to finish writing a part that someone else needs for another part
