## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

    Scope is where the variables var, let, and const are available for use. 

2. What is Hoisting ?

    This is where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code is executed in JavaScript

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

    You would use 'let' if you ever wanted to have something be updated but you can't re-declare its name in it's respected scope. 
    You would use 'const' if you didn't want your variable to be updated or re-declared. You must initialize this one though during declaration.
    Var is globally or function scoped. You would use 'var' if you wanted to use a variable in multiple places in your code. You can both update and re-declare this one in it's respected scope.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

There is a difference between var, let, and const. They may all declare a variable, but each does something a little different. Which perhaps why something is not working in your code is because you have used the wrong variable declaration. There is another place to problem shoot.
