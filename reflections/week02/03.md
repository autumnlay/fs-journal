## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

    The main ways are console.log() and console.error('error.message'). You will use console.log() the most frequent to check if your JavaScript functions are doing what you want them to do. The error one is useful for when you are trying to debug your code.

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

    This is the Elements tab. It is useful because we can go into our HTML and see where on the screen that HTML is being used and where our error or undesired affect is directly coming from.

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

    You can use a 'debugger' which will pause your code on that line. Then you can make the code run piece by piece after that point to check for when you have an issue.

    Knowing how to better use the developer tools was really helpful because I have been a little confused at times in class as we have been using them. I was also wondering what the other tabs did, now I know.
