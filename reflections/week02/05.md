# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

    As always the beginning of this week was slightly overwhelming with all the new information about JavaScript. At first I was confused on calling the functions and what that ment and what 'invoked' ment. Then I understood how to call the function, but I did not understand what I should be writing in the function. The theme of the week was "You are on the right track!" and then have a TA say "now you just put in ______" like a .find or .indexOf. I was shocked at some of the '._______' there were that made what I was trying to do SOO much easier. I feel more comfortable with JavaScript in general, but I sometimes have a hard time with calling the JavaScript to the HTML files. I also am struggling with getting from "on the right track!" to "on track", but I learned that to get to this point, I just have to continue to practice with JavaScript.
