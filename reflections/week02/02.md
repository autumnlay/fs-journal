## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?
    1) function name(parameters){}
    2) let name = function(parameters){}
    3) let name = (parameters) => {}

    In version one, the function can be used before it is defined. In version two the function is set anonymous to a variable. In version three the arrow functions do not create its own 'this' value.

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

    Parameters are names created in the function definition.
    Arguments are values the function receives from each parameter when the function is invoked.

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

    This is when a function returns another function.
