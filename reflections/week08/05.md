# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

The backend is going superwell!! There have been a couple of hard parts with the collaborators, notifications and challenges parts of our project. But we have been working as a team and it is all going very well. Notifications was definatly the hardest part.
I'm realizing i need to do more in vue though...
I've been in the backend for a while now and I am forgetting everything about vue now. This is worrysome. But I am understanding the backend even more in depth than before.
It's been a good experience!
