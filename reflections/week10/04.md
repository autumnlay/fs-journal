## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?
    An Enum is a strongly typed constant. We would use them to make a program more readable, we may replace a repeated part of code with an enum to accomplish this. 

2. How can you modify an Enum?
    You can't change an enum value, but you can modify the base type and member values of an enumusing the Volume enum

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)
    I think I could of used some in the Rock-Paper-Scissors game we made the first day. Especially since there were parts of the code that were very similar.
