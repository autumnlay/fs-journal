## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?
    Value Type 
    Reference type
    Pointer type
    They all have a different place they hold memory

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript? 

    They are the values that hold thier own memory.
    The name of these variables is very similar to javascript, you just have to be more specific with what type of data type it is instead of just int char and stuff. 

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?
    There is a lot of of like renameing it looks like going on. Things are defined by thier numeral values to thier words. Everything has a reference to something else.
