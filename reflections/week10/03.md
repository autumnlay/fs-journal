## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?
    Columns contain the name, data type and attribute. Rows contain the records or data for the columns. 

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.
    CREATE TABLE characters(
        name string, 
        age string,
        description string, 
        id int NOT NULL
    )

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
DROP TABLE table_name;
```
    The DELETE FROM is just removing rows from tables where as DROP TABLE is removing an entire table.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

This assignment was a little bit more difficult for me to do because I didn't really understand what I was doing in the begining. The tables confused me and there was little detail on what I was actually supposed to include in my afternoon challenge. But I eventually got a couple of things figured out.
