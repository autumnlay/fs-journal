# Daily Reflection
Have you started the client? How is you vue application shaping up. Do you have the basics of data rendering to the page.  

## Prompts
- How is today going? 
- Are you managing your stress?
- What has you most worried?

    I FINALLY GOT MY SERVER DONE!!!!!!!!!!! I AM SO HAPPY!!!! and I started to get my client side going. I am most excited that I FINALLY got my modal to pop!!! When I worked on this at home I was able to get a lot of the client side visually looking good, and I am really happy about that!!! I finally feel like I am in a good place and that I can be successfull. I have to do a lot of functionality tomorrow, but for now I got the stuff looking a lot better!
