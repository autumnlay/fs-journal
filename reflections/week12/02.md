# Daily Reflection
Two full days in! Did you make the progress you were hoping for yesterday and today? How are you working? Client -> Server, focusing only on the server for now?  

## Prompts
- How is today going? 
- Are you managing your stress?
- What has you most worried?

I have worked a little bit on the client side now, and because of that I am not feeling as worried about not making the deadline. I am struggling a lot with the backend right now and am very disappointed my backend isn't finished yet. I was really hoping I'd have it done by now. Today was a lot of hard coding for me... I am close to getting my tests passing. When I got home though, I found out my tables from my scalegride.io and Sql tables are completely not working, and I am SOOO sad about that!!! I was hoping to have the server side done by now... But accourding to Jake Overall, I am still on pace. So, I am reminding myself that I am still on track and can do this. I keep having to tell myself that I can do this, that way I continue to progress and not get super bogged down in feeling overwhelmed. Just take things step-by-step.
