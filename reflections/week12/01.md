# Daily Reflection
This is a stressful week! You are working on a project that closely mimics what you will be expected to accomplish during a standard 40 hour work week. Are you enjoying the struggles? Are you managing your time wisely? 

## Prompts
- How is today going? 
- Are you managing your stress?
- What has you most worried?

Today is going good so far. I am making a lot of progress on the backend. There was somethings I was confused about, like with vaultKeeps, and I was able to clarify what I was supposed to do with those. I was hoping to have the back-end really close to done, I am not that far yet. But I am still making good progress. I would say I'm managing my time wisely, and I feel mixed with my struggles right now. I find it hard with some of the C# code, but I'm figuring it out. I'm a little worried about finishing on time just because I am scared this is going to take me longer to fix then I want it to.
