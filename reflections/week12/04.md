- Are you managing your stress?
- What has you most worried?

I got farther than I thought I would! I kept getting overwhelmed by all of the work I had to do to get things to pass... I had to keep giving myself positive affirmations that I CAN do this! I needed to reming myself to take things one task at a time and not try and do everything all at once, or think about it all at once. I got my first grade done today. I didn't pass it, which was expected. BUT now I know that I am really close and I know alot of the things I have to do to be able to get all the other things passing! I'm PUMPED that this stuff is finally working!! I had ALOT of successes today, and I would say that I am officially enjoying my struggles because I am finally able to figure out alot of my problems out for myself. I think I might actually pass the final now!
