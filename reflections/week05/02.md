## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?

one to one
one to many
many to many

2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`

embedding is more effecient, but linking uses a foreign key so it only exists as part of the application level schema. 

3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?

there is many relations ships, so you want to see how many "N"s you can have in a relations ship, and what the max number of "M"s are in your relation ship. Depending on how many you have will help you determine how to embed it. N being the number of connections, m being the multiple ways things could get into it.
