## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?

Timeboxing is a time management technique that involves assigning fixed units of time to an activity or task in advance and then completing that activity or task during the designated time frame. 

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?

Practice and adapt, choose a time, and if I need more or less time, adjust. 
Know your golden hour, I need to figure out what time during the day am I most productive, and do the hardest work during that time. 
Start with the hardest task first
I might also use Focusmate. 

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 

I think doing shorter timeboxing would help me when working in the lab. Also when I am at home working on assignments or tasks. I think I should try and implement this more to my everyday life.
I remember in college I had my own version of time boxing, but I refferred to it as time management. But I would try and do the hardest tasks first, unless they took too much time, then I would move on.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

I am starting to understand the many relationships. I didn't know where in the relationships I should start. At first I wanted to start int the middle and then build in both directions, but I learned quickly that that was not effective, and you have to start with the first parent first.
