## Questions

1. What does REST stand for, and in simple terms what does it mean?

REpresentational State Transfer. It means when a RESTful API is called, the server will transfer to the client a representation of the state of the requested resource.

2. What does Stateless mean?

Stateless means the server does not remember anything about the user who uses the API.

3. What URL pattern is used when writing a RESTful API?

Example 1:
http://example.com/api/{API version}/{path for identifying a resource}

Example 2:
http(s)://{Domain name (:Port number)}/{A value indicating REST API}/{API version}/{path for identifying a resource}
