# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?


This week was sort of hard for me. Over all I enjoyed the struggle. But it took me a while to even realize why we were doing what we were doing. Why the MVC pattern and what each part of the MVC pattern did. Everything becomes increasingly more difficult as well the more we add new scripts. I start to get confused which one is doing what and where each one is. All the different tabs were very difficult to follow. Of course towards the end of the week I started to get all the parts figured out and everything is finally starting to make sense. It just is still hard with all the many tabs...
