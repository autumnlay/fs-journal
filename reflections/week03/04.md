> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?

    One problem is that you need a way to update parts of a page in response to certain events with the data provided. It also helps us when it comes to client-sided scripting, and when we have many elements that must be insync with one another.

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

 The three are subscribe, unsubscribe and broadcast.

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

    Honestly I am not sure... but I think that the two just talk to each other and call to eachother. One of the ways the talk is with the "." part of it. That with the .observers, listeners like .on and .then .broadcast()

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

    I like how useful the obsever pattern can be and the different levels there are to it. It can help us kind of wave towards our code on how the computer can tell when an event happens.
