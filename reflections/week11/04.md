## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.
    I am so very nervous for this final. I know I have been prepared for this, but I don't think I have actually put in the time and effort to effectivly learn the skills that I need. I am very very nervouse for this final. After the lecture, I feel a little more confident in what I am doing. I have been very lost in Vue, but after talking with Mark, alot more of it started to make sense. I realized a couple of things of why some of my stuff just hasn't been working like... at all. It was because I was doing a lot of it wrong... oops. 
    I have both disliked and liked all the different applications that we have built. I disliked them because they stressed me out, and I felt like I had no idea how to do certain things in them. I liked them because after I finally got something to work the way I had been intending, I was really proud of how far I had come. I am excited for my journey ahead in software developement. 
    Something that is comforting to me is that even though I might fail my final, I still have a job or can get a job coming out of the course. I am excited to see what the future will hold for me. 
    I have more peace for the final, but like I said, I'm stressed about it because it sort of overwhelms me of all the things we have to do for it. I am just hoping I am able to make it all work in a timely manner... I'm hoping to have the back-end finished and running with no bug by the end of the day Monday and then start on that front-end. I'm telling myself I should have almost everything done by Wednesday that way I can give myself a two-day flex time because I know that there are going to be parts of the front end that will be very difficult for me. But, here is to the hope that I do end up passing the final despite all my insecurtities about it!

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

So... we didn't have an assignment today because we were just reviewing. But I found the review on Vue VERY important and now I think I finally understand how to use a modal and a computed. I hope my final goes well and I don't get too distracted...
