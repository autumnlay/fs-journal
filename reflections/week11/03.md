## Questions

1. What is SQL injection?
    SQL injection is a type of attack that can give an adversary complete control over your web application database by inserting arbitrary SQL code into a database query.

2. What are 3 methods SQL injection can be done by?
    In-band SQLi(Classic), Interfential (Blind) and Out-of-band.

3. How can we detect and sanitize SQL injection attacks?
    Same way as COVID... lol, just kidding.
    First off, you can have a firewall (WAF) to detact a block basic SQL injection attact, but also have an IDS. We can deleat some of the default settings as well to protect ourselves further. Also consider what privileges you want the database to be given. Delete things that are unnessesary.
