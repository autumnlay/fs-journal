## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`

    Primary Keys are how we identify what records on a table. Foreign keys are what we use to reference data on another table through the primary keys.

2. What is an `Alias`?
  This is to name something that could be really long, to an "alias" or a shorter abreviated name. 

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

```

SELECT * FROM doctors d, patients p
INNER JOIN Doctors ON Patients

I am learning more of the many-to-many relationships. Still a little confused here and there, but I think I am understanding it.
