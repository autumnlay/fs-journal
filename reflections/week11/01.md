## Questions

1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?
    It allows us to reuse code with parent-child relationships

2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?
    Member Inheritance is the relationship between the parent and child components. There are Private and Public members. The class does inherit the member's base class, but that depends on it's derived class.

3. How does accessibility affect inheritance?
    The Private vs Public. If it is private, members aren't visible from the child classes. If it is public the members are accessible and part of the public interface of the child class.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

I was able to work more on the AllSpice assignment, and I learned that the reason I couldn't spin up my front end this whole time, was because I had a parent file with the name "C#" the "#" really messed me up.... so don't have any files with that or a "-" in it, only "_".
