3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

    There are different levels or degrees of wire framing. I have been doing more of a mid-level wireframe lately. It makes sence why we do wire-framing. I thought it was just a given that this is a necessary component to all of this, and I didn't know it all had a name for it!
