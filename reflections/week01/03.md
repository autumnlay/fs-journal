## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

    A tip that surprised me was how you shouldn't make text grey in a colored background, you should try to mess with transperancy instead on the text or the background color. Also how you should or should not blow up icons on small screens vs bigger screens.

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

    I'm a little confused by this question. Do you want me to look up other resources or is this in my text alread?

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

    First off, your website is the first impression of you and your company, product, etc. First impressions are very important. If the website is for a product, then doing all of the design elements can convince people to buy your product in a more effective way. I people like what they see, then they are more likly to stay on your site and explore more into it.
