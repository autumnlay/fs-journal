## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

    A Pseudo-Class is an added special effect to elements from a specific state. I think the most common one I would use would be :first-child or :hover because I have seen it the most in examples. 

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

    Specificity is something we need to be aware of in CSS. It is the 'order' or the 'urgency of the order' in CSS. It is the rules that determine which style will be applied to whichever element. This can be benificial for when you have the same element that has multiple declarations. Which one will win? By knowing the specificity, you can know for sure and adjust what you need to accourdingly with the elements, especially when code is written porly or when the same element has multiple things happening to it color changes. 

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

    EVERYTHING becomes !important!! It then becomes confusing for the computer, and for a future coder looking at the code or trying to debug it. Specificity goes out the window. NEVER use this feature.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

I was so confused on CSS while trying to do the inclass assignment. I was confused on all the different styling things. I now understand CSS better and how it works in buidling the website. One big factor of that is the ways you call the classes from your HTML and have them come over and hang out in your CSS. In CSS is where whatever you named in HTML gets put, it is told where to go.
