## Questions

1. In your own words, why do we use Git?

We use Git so that we can work in parallel with other developers. It is a place where we can store the code we have been working on. 


2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

Having multiple branches helps support multiple parrellel units of code. You and someone else can be working on the same base code, and then later merge your work into one place. Two people can be working on the same project at the same time. 


3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub

Git is used to store code. GitHub is a place where people can see all of the coding work I have done. GitHub is like my coding resume.
In addition, Git is more of a local repository, and GitHub is more of a remote repository.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

I have learned the importance of git and GitHub. I have also learned about the different repositories. A local one is just for me to see and work on, and a remote repository is one everyone can see. 
I also learned that I had the wrong software downloaded there for a while for my code... But I learned that more in class than from this assignment.
