## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

We mostly implimented the partner coding document. Having someone be the driver and someone else be the navigator. We kind of dropped doing that mid-way through the week, and this proved to be harmful for us. On Thursday though we went back to doing doing a better partner callaboration. 

2. What went well this week?

The beginning of the week we did well getting the project started and getting the backend going and finished. We stayed on track and on target with our goals in the beginning of the week and splitting up our tasks. 

3. What would you do differently?

In the beginning of the week, we had one partner working on the front end, the design of our site. We trusted this individual to structure the Vue asspects well and to name things appropriatly. If I could of gone back, I would of had our middle person go back and help them to make sure that the naming and structuring was better. This would have made our front-end to back-end wiring waaayyy smoother. I also would of had us communicated better on Wednesday and got help sooner than later so that we would not of felt so paniced on Thursday and got to the point that we were on thursday. Which the point we were at was stressed and overwhelmed.
